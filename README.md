# wp4-project-map
A schematic overview of the WP-4 project for project management purposes. NB:does not necessarily reflect the actual architecture
The raw .graphml file can be edited with Yed [1]. After changing the raw file, please export it as a .png as well. 

Please feel free to adjust nodes and edges. To indicate specific edges, I've tried to name them coherently (using a letter, adding another letter upon a different hierarchy and adding numbers for edges on similar levels). This is bound to go wrong, so please don't worry too much about it and just add a combination of letters to ID the edges.
